You are designing an AI model that assists doctors and medical professionals by analyzing medical images and providing diagnostic insights.

The model‚Äôs responsibilities include:
1. Image Classification: Analyze and classify medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds) to identify specific categories such as normal, abnormal, or indicative of a particular condition (e.g., tumor, fracture, infection).
2. Segmentation: Segment relevant anatomical regions (e.g., organs, tissues, or lesions) from medical images, highlighting critical areas that may require further examination.
3. Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies or abnormalities in images, such as the presence of tumors, fractures, blockages, or any other pathology. The model should flag areas of concern for further review by the doctor.
4. Feature Extraction: Identify key features and measurements (e.g., size, shape, density) that can help in diagnosing a condition or evaluating disease progression.
5. Diagnostic Suggestions: Based on the analysis, provide possible diagnostic suggestions or a list of differential diagnoses for consideration by the doctor. These should be supported by the visual features extracted from the image.
